# Log Analysis
This is the Log Analysis Project for the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.
This project deals with python and relational databases.

This project contains three files:
+ README.md
+ Python file (log_analysis.py) with the program to query the database.
+ An output.txt that provides the program's output for the questions.

The task is to use SQL queries and answer three questions:
1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

==How to run==
The python program will query the database "news". If you haven't yet created the database,
please download the "newsdata.sql" and use the following command in the command line "psql -d news -f newsdata.sql"
to execute the statements in "newsdata.sql" and create the database "news".


# How to run script
